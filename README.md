# Short-Distance-Stepping
Short distance human stepping includes a lot of variants. Stance type, stepping length, location, turning side, step type are some of these variants which make short distance human stepping hard to model. Prototyping and understanding short distance human stepping is quite important for virtual prototyping human locomotion. The solution to tackle this problem should be accurate and fast. In the experiment made by Mr. Pisupati, marker data is converted into 2-D body and feet trajectories.
